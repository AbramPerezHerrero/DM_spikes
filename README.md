# Dark matter spikes
Code to compute the dark matter spike density profile for three different initial dark matter halo profiles (Hernquist, power-law and super-Navarro-Frenk-White).

For an example of use, see the Jupyter Notebook.

To run it, it is necessary to have some python packages installed. In particular, the Astropy package.
